# Unsupervised Machine Learning for Cancer Epidemiology Mapping in New Caledonia

This project applies unsupervised learning to analyze cancer epidemiology in New Caledonia. It aims to discover hidden patterns and at-risk population groups using clustering algorithms. The local context presents unique challenges: significant geographical disparities in healthcare access, specific environmental risk factors, and cultural diversity affecting health behaviors. This data-driven mapping seeks to support public health strategy optimization across the Caledonian territory, helping to target prevention and resources more effectively.
